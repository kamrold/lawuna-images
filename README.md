# lawuna-images

Imagesof pollutants taken at the shores of lake victoria, a fresh water body in Uganda.

## How?
A camera was used, however, a drone will be employed to take more images

## Why?
The images collected are our data inputs for the Lawuna app.

### purpose of this project
The project is designed to detect images at the shores of fresh water bodies with artificial intelligence embroidered into the drone.
The supervised learning used helps it to detect the object by name using a model that has been trained to do exactly that with a high probability rate
of proper indentification upon detection. These images are then sent directly to a server for storage and later analysis.

###
Images during the training are labelled using various tools like labelimg and are later split into two folders
1. trained
2. test
The trained set is estimated at 80% while the test set is estimated at 20%
